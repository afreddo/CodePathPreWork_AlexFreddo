# Prework - CodePathPreWork_AlexFreddo

Submitted by: Alexander Freddo

CodePathPreWork_AlexFreddo is an app that displays my name, the university I am attending, and my desired position after graduating. It has two buttons that the user can press either setting the app background or the text color displayed to random colors.

Time spent: 3 hours spent in total

## Required Features

The following **required** functionality is completed:

- [X] Users are see a screen with three labels and a button
- [X] Tapping the button changes the screen color to a random color

## App Brainstorming (Step 4)

My 5 favorite applications are as follows (in no particular order):

Flighty
- Flights are tracked on a scrollable map that update in real-time with no need for internet access.
- The connectivity to many different APIs to populate tables with useful flight information

Reddit
- Stringing together posts and comments seemlessly
- Storing user's post and comment history

Amazon
- Use of different views to view products in many different ways
- Payment screen UI/UX

Google Maps
- Detail views for different locations
- Location type filters

Youtube
- Video previews on thumbnails
- Ability to access videos without storing locally

## Notes

Storyboards are new to me and I found the concept of providing different functionality for different buttons to be a challenge. I ended up realizing that I could add both of the buttons to the same IBAction and used an if/else statement to switch the intended functionality.
