# Prework - CodePathPreWork_AlexFreddo

Submitted by: Alexander Freddo

CodePathPreWork_AlexFreddo is an app that displays my name, the university I am attending, and my desired position after graduating. It has two buttons that the user can press either setting the app background or the text color displayed to random colors.

Time spent: 3 hours spent in total

## Required Features

The following **required** functionality is completed:

- [X] Users see a screen with three labels and a button

## App Brainstorming (Step 4)

My 5 favorite applications are as follows (in no particular order):

Flighty
- Flights are tracked on a scrollable map that update in real-time with no need for internet access.
- The connectivity to many different APIs to populate tables with useful flight information

Reddit
- Stringing together posts and comments seemlessly
- Storing user's post and comment history

Amazon
- Use of different views to view products in many different ways
- Payment screen UI/UX

Google Maps
- Detail views for different locations
- Location type filters

Youtube
- Video previews on thumbnails
- Ability to access videos without storing locally

I have an idea for an app called "Pup Pack" to help connect dog owners. Dog owners often struggle to find ways to socialize their dog. This is amplified when owners move to new locations where they haven't had time to build their social circle. My app would be a social media app that allows dog owners to create a profile exclusively for their dog. The profile would include information about the pup including listing likes and dislikes (e.g, Likes adult dogs, does not do well with puppies, etc). They could then find other dogs in the area that would be compatible with their dog and could set meetups at local parks. This would allow both the pup and the owner to meet new people and grow their pup's pack.

Some features of the app could include the following:
- Profile creation
- Local storage of profile information
- Use of MapKit to display local parks and look for dog meetups
- User authentication
- Sharing of information between different user's devices

## Notes

Storyboards are new to me and I found the concept of providing different functionality for different buttons to be a challenge. I ended up realizing that I could add both of the buttons to the same IBAction and used an if/else statement to switch the intended functionality.
